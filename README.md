*(Please note that the repository has been set up for Unity version 2019.4.19f1)*

The following template repository includes the 2D Game Kit provided by Unity, albeit with a few minor changes (in the form of additional prefabs). The 2D Game Kit will be used to create a simple platformer. Note that opening the project in Unity for the first time may take a bit of time.


For more information on the assignment, including a tutorial on how to use the Game Kit and the assignment rubric/requirements, please visit iLearn.
